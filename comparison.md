# **Comparison of HTTP Versions: 0.9 → 1.1 → 2.0 → 3.0**

## 📌 Introduction
The **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** has evolved significantly from its initial version, **HTTP 0.9**, to the modern, efficient **HTTP 3.0**.  
Each version introduced improvements in **speed, security, reliability, and flexibility** to accommodate the ever-growing needs of the internet.

## 🔍 **Side-by-Side Comparison of HTTP Versions**

| **Feature**          | **HTTP 0.9** (1991) | **HTTP 1.1** (1997) | **HTTP 2.0** (2015) | **HTTP 3.0** (2021) |
|----------------------|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Request Methods**  | Only `GET`         | `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc. | Same as HTTP 1.1 | Same as HTTP 2.0 |
| **Headers**         | ❌ No headers       | ✅ Full headers support | ✅ Compressed headers (HPACK) | ✅ Encrypted headers (QUIC) |
| **Status Codes**    | ❌ None             | ✅ Introduced (e.g., `404 Not Found`, `500 Error`) | ✅ Same as HTTP 1.1 | ✅ Same as HTTP 2.0 |
| **Connection Type**  | Closes after response | Persistent connections (Keep-alive) | Persistent (Multiplexed streams) | Persistent (QUIC-based) |
| **Multiplexing**    | ❌ No               | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes (Parallel requests) | ✅ Yes (No head-of-line blocking) |
| **Server Push**     | ❌ No               | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes (Proactively sends resources) | ✅ Yes (Optimized for streaming) |
| **Security**        | ❌ None             | ✅ Basic TLS support | ✅ Improved encryption | ✅ QUIC encryption by default |
| **Performance**     | 🚫 Slow due to new connections per request | ⚡ Improved but still sequential | 🚀 Faster due to multiplexing | 🚀⚡ Fastest due to QUIC |
| **Adoption**       | ❌ Obsolete         | ✅ Still widely used | ✅ Growing adoption | 🔄 Emerging standard |

## ✅ **Key Improvements Across Versions**
1. **HTTP 1.1** solved connection inefficiencies, introduced status codes, headers, and caching.
2. **HTTP 2.0** improved speed with multiplexing, header compression, and server push.
3. **HTTP 3.0** eliminated TCP limitations by **switching to QUIC**, enabling **even lower latency** and **better mobile performance**.

## ❌ **Challenges & Limitations**
| **Version**  | **Challenges** |
|-------------|---------------|
| **HTTP 0.9** | No headers, status codes, or error handling |
| **HTTP 1.1** | Head-of-line blocking, large header overhead |
| **HTTP 2.0** | Still relies on TCP, limited adoption |
| **HTTP 3.0** | Requires QUIC support, higher CPU usage |

## 🔥 **Final Thoughts**
Each HTTP version has brought significant **advancements in efficiency, security, and scalability**.  
HTTP 3.0 is currently the **most optimized and fastest protocol**, providing **low-latency, encrypted** connections for modern web applications.

🚀 *The future of HTTP continues to evolve—ensuring a faster, more reliable internet!*
